# Decorators
This is a task to learn a usage of decorators. We have a an array of Nodes, which we modify only by creating new nodes using Decorators, of different types, or with different parameters.

Very important!
This code was not mostly made by me. This is a task from our professor we were just to change code in Node.cs. I didn't write any other parts of this code!

To use those files just upload them into a new visual studio project.
